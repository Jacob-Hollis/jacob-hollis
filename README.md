<h3 align=center>I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer</h3>

#### 🤝 Connect with me:

Here you'll find projects I enjoy building to learn web technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and React 🚀.  
You'll also find some Python projects that I've built for fun and to make my life a little easier 🎉.

My professional experience primarily centers in C# and .NET development, with some Java. However, you won't find most of it here, as this is where I prefer to explore different technologies.  

This portfolio hosts my current open-source work that I use to expand my professional career knowledge in software engineering.  

Feel free to take a look around, and have a great day! 😊

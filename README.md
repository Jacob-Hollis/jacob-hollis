### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub portfolio ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find projects I enjoy building to learn web technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and React ðŸš€.  
You'll also find some Python projects that I've built for fun and to make my life a little easier ðŸŽ‰.

My professional experience primarily centers in C# and .NET development, with some Java. However, you won't find most of it here, as this is where I prefer to explore different technologies.  

This portfolio hosts my current open-source work that I use to expand my professional career knowledge in software engineering.  

Feel free to take a look around, and have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
